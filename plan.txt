soldering pads are breaking:
1. when throttle/motors max at - 1450
2. buy flux paste, try to put on the spldering pads
3. maybe because batteris is 2s instead of 1s - test esc * motor alone with 1s battery vs 2s battery

debug bug where on start motors spin very slowly - no mpu values, something bad on gyto start, add some warning ? always happens on first start with battery, second start is fine
1. try add pause of 1 sec before turn on the gyro

check noise again after fix mpu, make sure noise roll/pitch is similar
add scematic of boards
new board with sd card (maybe bluethooth), take measurements of all signals
add fpv camera
switch to elrs protocol
switch to dshot
flash beyjay / am32 once duplicate esc's are arriving
